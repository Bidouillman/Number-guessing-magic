# Number guessing magic

Welcome to the Mind Reader Magic repository! This is a simple batch script that performs a magic trick to guess the number you're thinking of.

3. You'll be asked to think of a number between 1 and 31.
4. The script will proceed to guess your number through a series of questions.
5. It assigns a value to each set of numbers based on your responses.
6. Finally, it calculates the total value of the possible numbers and reveals its guess.
